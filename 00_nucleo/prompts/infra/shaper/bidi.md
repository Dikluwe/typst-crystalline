**Layer:** L3
**Exclusive consumer:** `03_infra/src/shaper/bidi.rs`

## Current evidence

- `03_infra/src/shaper/bidi.rs:11` — `BidiRun`.
- `03_infra/src/shaper/bidi.rs:30` — `bidi_runs`.

These are local source anchors, not a new upstream parity measurement.
Reproduce discovery with `rg -n "fn |struct |enum |mod |pub use" 03_infra/src/shaper/bidi.rs`.

## Owned contract

- Own BidiRun and bidi_runs only: logical paragraph order, visual run order, original substrings, direction and absolute byte_start.
- Use unicode-bidi with automatic base direction and its visual_runs for every paragraph. Retain empty paragraphs and omit trailing class-B separators from shaping ranges.
- Empty input yields no runs. UTF-8 clusters refer to the original string. Font selection, run shaping and position adjustment belong to other owners; no vertical-text policy is added.

## Verification and boundary

Verify this unit through its existing family/CLI tests when validating behavior.
Ownership is strictly prompt-to-consumer 1:1 (ADR-0129); referenced owners do not share this prompt.
Preserve existing public contracts, defaults and pipeline phases. Referenced child owners govern their own implementations; dependencies do not create shared ownership.

## Full-paragraph bidi context

### Evidence

`lab/results/construction/diagnostics/bidi-contexto-2026-10-05/{initial,probe}.json.gz`
retains bilateral cases/Unicode refutation and sources/state/binaries.
`layout_bidi.rs:73–82,227–240` redetects base/invents separators;
`shaper/bidi.rs:34` redetects a fragment, losing the human-ratified complete input.
This internal parity correction adds no phase or external public signature.

### Boundary contract and acceptance

For certified spans, use the compilation-local registry of auxiliary strings/maps
by input Arc, then normally borrowed BidiInfo views; no unsafe/self-reference.
Virtual LRE/RLE/PDF is inserted only when segment direction differs from base.
Retain real spaces, nonjustified Linebreak LF and author controls; justify=true
is outside certification. Resolve once per input per registry; paged pipeline
shares registry/views between reorder/shape. Existing public wrappers may create
a local equivalent registry.

Reorder queries the actual line interval, exact segment/range intersections and
end-of-line levels, never midpoints or invented spaces. Split mixed Text at original
boundaries preserving style/subspan. Nontext items and unknown sources gain no
certificate. Preserve the L1-accepted physical anchor and actual width/advance;
certified context cannot use suffix/coalescing fallback.

Shaping queries full-input runs for each original span without fragment direction
redetection, preserving sequential subrun offsets and exact TextShaped subspans.
The existing cache key already distinguishes direction; add no context to
TextStyle. Reconciliation uses input base when present, not any RTL run; retain
prior None fallback. Require RED→GREEN for `456 789` refutation, overrides/neutrals,
no auxiliary controls in extracted text and bilateral measurements. Registry
implementation is exclusively owned by `00_nucleo/prompts/infra/bidi_context.md`;
reordering and shaping remain with their own canonical owners.
