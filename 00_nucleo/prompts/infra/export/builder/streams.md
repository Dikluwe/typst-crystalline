**Layer:** L3
**Exclusive consumer:** `03_infra/src/export/builder/streams.rs`
**Governance:** ADR-0107, ADR-0108, ADR-0109, ADR-0127, ADR-0129, ADR-0130

## Consumer evidence

`03_infra/src/export/builder/streams.rs:20` identifies the current exclusive consumer. The clauses below
are checked against that source and its delegated calls. They specify current
export observables and ownership, not full upstream byte or algorithm equality.

## Physical page-stream envelope

Own only the byte envelope around already generated page operators. In Compact
serialization, use FlateDecode when compression succeeds and reduces length;
otherwise retain raw bytes and omit Filter. In Pretty serialization, page content
streams remain uncompressed and readable. This exception does not change compression
of fonts, images, ICC profiles or other streams, nor graphics StreamMode or PdfTags.
Apply the existing oracle transformation only when explicitly enabled; disabled is
identity. Do not create graphics operators or choose product defaults.

## Verification

Check profitable/unprofitable compression, failure fallback, readable Pretty streams
and oracle-off identity without conflating physical serialization and graphic mode.


## Prepared Shape fixture transport

### Evidence and approval

`lab/results/construction/diagnostics/tiling-nativo-2026-10-14/before.json.gz`
retains HEAD/tree/diffstat/UTC/sources/owners before migration. layout_types.rs:510–511
carried Paint/Stroke; shape.rs:151–191 materialized only group fills; tiling.rs:85
limited/cloned its grid. prepare_cell already returns TilingFrame once per
occurrence. `tiling-preparacao-2026-10-14/{before,after}-renders/results.json.gz`
shows dense-open/stroke-open divergences across all three targets. Manifesto
`d0c1f0c189769ccb40eb538e09e251ce1fd56650cbb23b2b94c357a1341ba32d` was approved;
receipt `lab/history/construction/records/00_nucleo/materialization/tiling-transporte-2026-10-14/approval-receipt.json`.
Preparation/object counts are transport mechanics; rendering/outlines/text/geometry/
diagnostics are language observables.

### Contract and acceptance

Migrate FrameItem::Shape fixtures to FramePaint/FrameStroke with unchanged values/
semantic assertions. Tiling explicitly constructs a prepared cell; eval fixtures
remain declarative. No total productive conversion or weakened assertion.
Consume the pinned nucleus. Approval supersedes only old approval-pending or
Shape-declarative-Paint/Stroke clauses within this package; other behavior survives.
L0 first, RED→GREEN, explicit fixture/consumer migration, no total From<Paint>,
carrier PartialEq or solid fallback merely to compile. Do not raise the old limit
or move layout to L3. Validate fill/stroke/resource/clipping/affine Parent/native-
target/Solid/Gradient/page semantics and full suite/build/doc/fmt/lineage. The
prepared transport, native-target integration and parity slices recorded as
T1c/T2/T3 are complete only after integrated verification; broken/partial states
are no production certificate. T4 and publication remain out of scope.
