## Evidence before specification

The current consumer implements the operations specified below at `01_core/src/compiler/layout/page_run.rs:14`.

Source inspection establishes current behavior and mechanical ownership; it is not a new bilateral parity measurement or evidence of upstream intent. Observable text, morphology, geometry and errors remain language-level obligations; buffer layout and traversal structure are implementation mechanics. Historical probes and their snapshot-specific qualifications are recorded in `lab/results/construction/diagnostics/sanitization-layout-history.md`. The former reference `9f2b6e8715237cb086899a42873660fe744622e8` and older vanilla pins are historical snapshots. They do not certify the current ratified reference `bd5ebec285505889e8ff1d4f68804ab147a699f3` without a new measurement.

## Ownership and contract

This prompt owns only the named consumer. State storage and general coordination remain in `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/layout/mod.md`; the contract below defines this unit's operations, not ownership of that hub.

Reject page configuration inside containers with the current diagnostic. Outside them, close and commit preceding material content before entering the run. Fold the run's geometry, numbering, marginal, supplement, columns, bleed, fill and canvas deltas over the previous PageConfig through the existing geometry helper and lexical precedence. Install local configuration on an empty page, dispatch the body, close a material terminal line and request the existing region transition. Mark the resulting empty boundary, then reinstall the previous configuration. Adjacent pagebreak consumption belongs to `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/layout/pagebreak.md`; preserve deliberate empty pages and existing wrapper materiality, while a direct private HTML marker alone is non-material.

## Acceptance and limits

Preserve the unit's current rendered content, morphology, causal positions/pages, styles and diagnostics, including the explicitly documented limits. Follow the existing static descendant interface without altering public signatures, defaults, compatibility or pipeline phase. This documentation does not authorize implementation of unresolved proposals.


## Approved physical page occurrence protocol

### Evidence before decision

At baseline HEAD `63b7b96b99109b61655b373dc0d248beb7838f86`, the complete source/owner snapshot and applicable ADRs are retained in `lab/results/set-page-header-2026-10-21/agents/core/source-evidence.json.gz` and its supplement. `baseline-parity/receipt.json` there binds current-pin physical query/state/counter/page observations and inert overwritten templates. `ambient-baseline/receipt.json` refutes freezing creation10pt styles: insertion uses actual page20/30pt ambient style. These are language observations; the source plan, packet transcript and rollback representation are mechanics. The exact five facades, opaque types and Paged discovery/realization/source-construction phase were explicitly approved in `lab/results/set-page-header-2026-10-21/review.md` (SHA-256 `cb4a684b483e7f9f6ac3f7eef52277f7ada405033a24e4e66e55811e93c12039`), recorded in `lab/results/set-page-header-implementation-2026-10-21/approval.json`. Only conflicting no-new-phase clauses for this exact protocol are superseded; legacy signatures/defaults and unrelated limits remain.

### Exclusive protocol responsibility

Save/restore selected running-template bindings and page-effective environment alongside the lexical PageConfig. Install only fields supplied by this run, preserving inherited slots; dispatch its body through the exact PageRunBody edge, while its four templates remain dormant until actual physical insertion. Preserve initial/terminal material-page boundaries, deliberate empties, container refusal and previous-configuration restoration. Do not replace progressive SetPage semantics with lexical PageRun or admit all PageRun templates during body traversal.

### Acceptance and preserved boundaries

Require semantic RED→GREEN for repeated physical header/footer/four-slot order, zero-paint updates, source-derived parents, overwritten inert templates, aliases and physical pages, effective20/30pt ambient plus explicit inner styles, nested PageRun restoration, Context reads, and exact duplicate-label/source diagnostics. Cover speculative suffix rollback, deferred floats/notes, subframes, measurement isolation, complete body/slot coverage, stale/mixed authority and math/par.line coexistence. Do not weaken existing tests, callback budgets, per-store sealing, source morphology, HTML isolation or old public compatibility. No generic painted-frame semantic reconstruction, source re-evaluation, second arena/Context solver, direct Func marginal mode, new default/flag or extra public API is authorized. Every changed descendant retains its own current 1:1 owner and explicit typed route; finite source inventories are not blanket traversal permission. Exhaustive new decisions need actual future-variant barriers, and the complete lineage/Nucleus, build/test/lint/Rustdoc/fmt/Clippy gates remain required without suppressions.


## Weak pagebreak parity correction — 2026-10-23

### Evidence before decision

`lab/results/weak-pagebreak-2026-10-23/baseline.json` binds the uncommitted source/L0/config state to HEAD, dirty stat and UTC; `before/receipt.json` binds both verified executables, inputs, commands and observations. `pagebreak.rs:21-58` ignores weak and always requests transitions; `finish.rs:103-106` requires the newly opened page unless it is a PageRun boundary. `page_run.rs:126-131` unconditionally closes its body. The pinned source `lab/typst-original/crates/typst-library/src/layout/page.rs:554-557` explicitly defines skipping weak breaks on empty pages; its tests `tests/suite/layout/pagebreak.typ:15-24,61-76` document weak/material distinctions. Initial, repeated, terminal and strong/weak controls plus parity and explicit PageRun probes distinguish language intent from mechanics. Page membership, content and geometry are observables; the private successor flag is a chosen mechanism. The inference that an optional successor suffices is refuted by lost notes/placed content, changed strong/parity empties, or leaked rollback state.

### Decision and exclusive responsibility

An explicit PageRun begins a required page, even when entering an optional weak successor. At its terminal boundary, do not commit an empty optional weak successor already opened by its body; preserve deliberate empty bodies and strong breaks. Keep the existing following-sibling boundary and running-template restoration.

This is an ADR-0127 continuous-flow language-parity correction: L0 first, reseal, RED→GREEN and complete revalidation. No public contract, default mode, pipeline phase or compatibility change is authorized. Existing nucleus obligations and unrelated limits remain binding.


## Refutation: unpainted material and required successors

### Evidence before decision

`lab/results/weak-pagebreak-2026-10-23/edge-after/receipt.json` and `unpainted-before/receipt.json` bind the first candidate executable to UTC/inputs/commands; its build and source state are in `validation.json` and `final-source.json.gz`. These controls refute painting alone as page materiality: hidden text, zero/fractional horizontal spacing and zero/weak/strong vertical spacing can require a page without paint; empty/metadata-only Hide does not. `h_space.rs:27-45` advances or queues spacing without an item, `v_space.rs:20-42` records advancement, and `hide.rs:20-28` removes only painted output. `pagebreak.rs:42-44` also overwrites an empty strong successor's requiredness during weak parity adjustment, dropping a required final page. These are language-visible page obligations, not a request to copy upstream collection mechanics. The earlier painting-only hypothesis was rejected, not qualified by changing the oracle or deleting its cases.

### Exclusive correction

Use the pagebreak owner material predicate at the initial boundary, including admitted unpainted content and deferred material. Preserve explicit empty PageRun pages and the unpainted material of a body.

L0 precedes code under continuous-flow ADR-0127. No public field, signature, trait, phase, default or compatibility change. Validate the refuters and retain all previous note/float/Context/column/strong/PageRun controls.
