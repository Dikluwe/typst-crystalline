**Layer:** L1
**Exclusive consumer:** `01_core/src/compiler/layout/flow_suffix.rs`
**Architecture:** ADR-0107, ADR-0108, ADR-0109, ADR-0127, ADR-0129, ADR-0130.

## Evidence before specification

The current consumer implements the operations specified below at `01_core/src/compiler/layout/flow_suffix.rs:15`, `01_core/src/compiler/layout/flow_suffix.rs:36`, `01_core/src/compiler/layout/flow_suffix.rs:97`.

Source inspection establishes current behavior and mechanical ownership; it is not a new bilateral parity measurement or evidence of upstream intent. Observable text, morphology, geometry and errors remain language-level obligations; buffer layout and traversal structure are implementation mechanics. Historical probes and their snapshot-specific qualifications are recorded in `lab/results/construction/diagnostics/sanitization-layout-history.md`. The former reference `9f2b6e8715237cb086899a42873660fe744622e8` and older vanilla pins are historical snapshots. They do not certify the current ratified reference `bd5ebec285505889e8ff1d4f68804ab147a699f3` without a new measurement.

## Ownership and contract

This prompt owns only the named consumer. State storage and general coordination remain in `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/layout/mod.md`; the contract below defines this unit's operations, not ownership of that hub.

Own acceptance/rejection and replay of the speculative flow suffix. Accumulate top-level occurrences in order while nested dispatch participates in the same unit. Ask Place's existing fitting helper whether newly queued floats fit; preserve the current acceptance conditions and boundary clearing rather than inventing a general fixpoint.

An accepted suffix clears its transaction/checkpoint/replay state before ordinary transition. A rejected suffix takes the hub checkpoint and replay list, restores the full captured tail through `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/layout/mod.md`, requests an ordinary Cursor transition, and re-dispatches the same occurrences through the non-reopening entry once. No prefix float, post-marker item, counter, location or attachment may be duplicated by replay. Do not peek at future Content, copy state into this module, translate only current_line or special-case Block/Place geometry. Region-progress policy remains in `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/layout/cursor.md`.

## Acceptance and limits

Preserve the unit's current rendered content, morphology, causal positions/pages, styles and diagnostics, including the explicitly documented limits. Follow the existing static descendant interface without altering public signatures, defaults, compatibility or pipeline phase. This documentation does not authorize implementation of unresolved proposals.


## Approved physical page occurrence protocol

### Evidence before decision

At baseline HEAD `63b7b96b99109b61655b373dc0d248beb7838f86`, the complete source/owner snapshot and applicable ADRs are retained in `lab/results/set-page-header-2026-10-21/agents/core/source-evidence.json.gz` and its supplement. `baseline-parity/receipt.json` there binds current-pin physical query/state/counter/page observations and inert overwritten templates. `ambient-baseline/receipt.json` refutes freezing creation10pt styles: insertion uses actual page20/30pt ambient style. These are language observations; the source plan, packet transcript and rollback representation are mechanics. The exact five facades, opaque types and Paged discovery/realization/source-construction phase were explicitly approved in `lab/results/set-page-header-2026-10-21/review.md` (SHA-256 `cb4a684b483e7f9f6ac3f7eef52277f7ada405033a24e4e66e55811e93c12039`), recorded in `lab/results/set-page-header-implementation-2026-10-21/approval.json`. Only conflicting no-new-phase clauses for this exact protocol are superseded; legacy signatures/defaults and unrelated limits remain.

### Exclusive protocol responsibility

Retain each replayed occurrence's exact source plan address/phase and environment together with its Content. Capture before the first speculative admission; rejection restores running protocol state, requests and consumption with all previous geometry/runtime tails, then replays the same typed occurrences on their accepted destination page exactly once. Acceptance retains the complete packet sequence once. No planned cursor lookup by Content equality, pointer, text or Location may replace this replay provenance.

### Acceptance and preserved boundaries

Require semantic RED→GREEN for repeated physical header/footer/four-slot order, zero-paint updates, source-derived parents, overwritten inert templates, aliases and physical pages, effective20/30pt ambient plus explicit inner styles, nested PageRun restoration, Context reads, and exact duplicate-label/source diagnostics. Cover speculative suffix rollback, deferred floats/notes, subframes, measurement isolation, complete body/slot coverage, stale/mixed authority and math/par.line coexistence. Do not weaken existing tests, callback budgets, per-store sealing, source morphology, HTML isolation or old public compatibility. No generic painted-frame semantic reconstruction, source re-evaluation, second arena/Context solver, direct Func marginal mode, new default/flag or extra public API is authorized. Every changed descendant retains its own current 1:1 owner and explicit typed route; finite source inventories are not blanket traversal permission. Exhaustive new decisions need actual future-variant barriers, and the complete lineage/Nucleus, build/test/lint/Rustdoc/fmt/Clippy gates remain required without suppressions.
