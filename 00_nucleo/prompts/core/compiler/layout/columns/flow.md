## Evidence before specification

At HEAD `f7195cdf6` (clean tree, 2026-09-30), the block is at `01_core/src/compiler/layout/columns.rs:125-191,640-704`. This observation establishes extraction boundaries, not performance or new bilateral parity.

`lab/results/construction/diagnostics/links-paginacao-2026-10-14.md` and receipts under `posicoes-compostas-2026-10-14/automatic-boundary-probes` record source, HEAD/dirty tree/UTC, binaries and vanilla pin. On a 160×40pt page with 10pt margins, ordinary text crosses the break; Link URL, Ref and Ref Page abort with a stale index after buffers are emptied. `references.rs:270` appears in the stack; `link.rs:22-32` uses the same mechanism. `outline.rs:28-50` also saves indices before the body. Clamping an index proves neither prefix/order/fragment/destination preservation nor geometry. The pre-repair snapshot is `lab/results/construction/diagnostics/links-captura-2026-10-14/before.json.gz`. Content, destination, regions and bounds are observables; private boundaries are mechanics.

## Ownership and contract

Layer L1. Sole productive consumer: `01_core/src/compiler/layout/columns/flow.rs`. Own continuous flow and block boundaries between columns, preserving collapse, cursor and pagination coordination. Preserve lexical capture through column transitions performed by `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/layout/columns/transitions.md`; no scope belongs to indices from the previous column.

Preserve public contract, default behavior, pipeline phase, compatibility, purity and static dispatch. Link capture is an internal correction under ADR-0127 with no new API, default or phase.

## Acceptance and limits

The L1 suite, build and crystalline-lint must pass. Separation does not prove a performance gain.

Require RED→GREEN for breaks before/within the body; preserve prefix/suffix, regions, destinations/bounds, rich body/nesting/columns, deferred content and context/rollback, with no private boundaries in output. Revalidate no-break controls, suite, build and lineage.


## Approved physical page occurrence protocol

### Evidence before decision

At baseline HEAD `63b7b96b99109b61655b373dc0d248beb7838f86`, the complete source/owner snapshot and applicable ADRs are retained in `lab/results/set-page-header-2026-10-21/agents/core/source-evidence.json.gz` and its supplement. `baseline-parity/receipt.json` there binds current-pin physical query/state/counter/page observations and inert overwritten templates. `ambient-baseline/receipt.json` refutes freezing creation10pt styles: insertion uses actual page20/30pt ambient style. These are language observations; the source plan, packet transcript and rollback representation are mechanics. The exact five facades, opaque types and Paged discovery/realization/source-construction phase were explicitly approved in `lab/results/set-page-header-2026-10-21/review.md` (SHA-256 `cb4a684b483e7f9f6ac3f7eef52277f7ada405033a24e4e66e55811e93c12039`), recorded in `lab/results/set-page-header-implementation-2026-10-21/approval.json`. Only conflicting no-new-phase clauses for this exact protocol are superseded; legacy signatures/defaults and unrelated limits remain.

### Exclusive protocol responsibility

Continuous planned flow uses the original ColumnsBody source child, while unplanned legacy callers retain their current constructed segment. Explicit colbreak segmentation records original child indices in the same construction pass that clones/pads/merges segments. Generated padding has no source packet. Preserve the original Source/at-most-one-Styled/Sequence spine and emit its source Root/PostChildren phases once around the sibling-region composition. Each actual segment child routes through its original source packet address, not through the index of a generated Sequence. Generated style wrappers keep existing geometry and do not duplicate source facts. The sequence owner supplies an optional exact per-part cursor route without changing grouping, fraction, direction, spacing or strategy.

Retain parallel footnote cursor queues together with the existing body queues at sibling-region entry/exit. Existing packet geometry carriers carry deferred child events to their accepted physical page in the same final projection pass. Do not infer source identity from copies, values, hashes, pointers or Locations, reconstruct global semantics from paint, activate new callback phases or alter any existing column/footnote geometry policy.


## R9 — source page-column admission and drain

Evidence before decision: candidate2 and candidate3 receipts under lab/results/construction/diagnostics/long-footnotes-r9-2026-10-24 preserve exact inputs, dirty stat, UTC and binaries. The first passes40/41; the wider68-case matrix refutes retaining context only at segmented exit: page-columns follows columns/flow.rs:119–126, which closes active columns before terminal draining. cols2-h80-n2 also measures Alpha atx20 versus155.2pt; cols2-h100-n3 unnecessarily defers a fitting whole-three entry. Pinned flow/compose.rs:650–777 measures admission at the source carrier and retains future column regions. These physical positions/pages are language, private state/dispatch is mechanics. This supersedes the refuted column follow-up saved in l0-column-followup.json, whose source changes were withdrawn without changing received code.

Classification: private parity/correctness, ADR-0127 continuous flow; no public field/signature/default/phase/compatibility change.

Exclusive owning obligation: Save/install/restore page_column_notes from the actual ColumnsElem page_columns argument. Only for that scope with a certified pending first note, restore the actual final causal carrier baseline after flush_line (as terminal finish does), flush pending notes and invoke the feature drain while column offsets/widths and original source scope remain active. Close/merge columns only after this finite certified drain; opaque/container paths remain unchanged. Do not materialize source content twice.

Require actual carrier-column RED→GREEN before implementation, the wider68-case PDF/SVG contract at unchanged0.001pt, original R8 and A–H/R1–R7 controls, unchanged effects, resources, full workspace validation, both lineage gates and preservation audits.
