# L0 — compiler/stdlib/tests/layout_context
Hash do Código: 0529aade

**Layer:** L1 test-only
**Exclusive consumer:** `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/tests/layout_context.rs`
**Governance:** ADR-0107, ADR-0129, ADR-0130.

## Contract

Own only the layout_context regression tests and their local fixtures/assertions. Use the private shared support fixtures. Preserve arguments, diagnostic messages, spans and language-level observations. Expectations must be independent of candidate output. Do not implement namespace behavior or transfer production contracts into this test consumer.

## Acceptance

Verify the owned behavior through local tests and its existing integrations.
Preserve public paths and observable results. Ownership, nucleus integrity and
lineage checks must remain valid; no unrelated consumer is authorized by this prompt.


## Ratified complete text size

### Evidence before decision

`lab/results/construction/diagnostics/text-argumentos-2026-10-17/before.json.gz`,
before-measurement.json.gz, morph-before-measurement.json.gz and audit.json
preserve HEAD `06848cdcb5450f2c555626bf116bc7acd82bd82b`, uncommitted working tree,
UTC, status/diffstat, sources/L0/binaries/argv and historical pin
`9f2b6e8715237cb086899a42873660fe744622e8`. named-em measures A at 0pt versus
24pt; affine 3pt versus 27pt; nested over 18pt measures 0pt versus 36pt. All six
Size/Color/body permutations are accepted by the pin and rejected by Tekt.
Positional set 18pt is ignored (12 versus 18pt). Pinned text/mod.rs:290,303,
924–930,1136–1142 and args.rs:178–247 establish typed search, named preference,
remaining body and composition. style_chain.rs:513–517 and constructor.rs:123
discard em; collapse at style_chain.rs:394–395,419–422 uses top-wins where size
needs a fold. Size/scope is observable language; Rust representation is an
internal choice. Infer no historical intent. Restoration, Raw, heading, math,
capture/show, duplicates/spans, zero/negative or metric failures can refute it.
The equality probe refuted comparing declared values: the pin returns true for
text(size:2em)[A] == text(size:24pt)[A]. Pinned StyledElem::eq at
content/mod.rs:779–782 compares child. That equality defect requires independent
correction; a complete size type does not close that axis.

### Ratification and limits

The human approved the complete-size package and its two public contracts in
manifest `771f5fd3d36545eb4b4fb7f0c0f2c91061470d1f010fc9a887b001a636d8feba`.
Require implementation and S1–S16 tests under 12 GiB/zero swap; no release/merge/
push. Reseal only after implementation and a valid graph. RG1 remains independent.

### Exclusive test-adapter responsibility

Change only test fixtures/adapters from Style::Size(Pt) to Size(absolute Length)
and StyleDelta.size expectations to Option<Length>. Preserve language observations
and existing functional contracts; never replace correct geometry with snapshots
of the new representation.
