# L0 — stdlib/collections/array_predicate — Array predicates and ordering
Hash do Código: 64716a0e

Layer: L1
Exclusive consumer: `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/collections/array_predicate.rs`

## Evidence before decision

The uncommitted working tree captured in `lab/results/construction/diagnostics/atomizacao-stdlib-collections-2026-09-30-before.json.gz` contains this family's routines in `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/collections.rs`; the complete L1 suite passed with 6401 tests and 2 ignored before extraction. This is structural measurement, not new bilateral vanilla parity evidence or a benchmark. The historical contract and vanilla pin qualifications remain in `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/stdlib/collections.md`.

## Language contract

filter, map, find, position, any, all and dedup preserve iteration, short-circuiting and callback invocation; predicates and sorted(by:) require Bool; dedup retains the first global occurrence and sorted preserves stability with key/by.

Bound-method dispatch and type exposure remain in the parent owner; both must call this behavior without algorithm duplication. Preserve operation identity, syntax, morphology, errors, spans and validation precedence of the measured implementation. Internal extraction preserves the public contract, default behavior, pipeline phase and compatibility.

## Acceptance

The L1 suite and `crystalline-lint .` must remain regression-free. Vanilla comparison must measure semantics, syntax and morphology under ADR-0107/0108 without assuming mechanical equality. Ownership remains 1:1 under ADR-0129/0130.
