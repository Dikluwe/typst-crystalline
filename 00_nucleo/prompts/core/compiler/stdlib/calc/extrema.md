# L0 — stdlib/calc/extrema
Hash do Código: 744ad99a

## Ownership and evidence

Layer L1. Exclusive productive consumer: `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/calc/extrema.rs`. At HEAD `d9e851a850c66905bdb0c3ea4b155a6f36881106` with a clean tree, `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/calc.rs:517-600` contains the corresponding behavior. SHA-256, time and state are recorded in `lab/results/construction/diagnostics/atomizacao-calc-2026-09-30-before.json.gz`. This decision only separates algorithms by behavior.

## Contract

Implement numeric min, max and clamp, preserving mixed promotion, nonempty input, and the requirement that the lower bound not exceed the upper bound, with existing diagnostics.

Parity details, types, diagnostics and bindings remain in `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/stdlib/calc.md`. Extraction preserves public signatures, module functions, phase, results and error policy. No I/O or mutable global state is permitted.

## Acceptance

Preserve the L1 suite and calc tests, build, and pass `crystalline-lint .` with correct ownership and hashes. Do not infer performance gains from this separation.
