# L0 — stdlib/shapes/polygon
Hash do Código: 334f19f0

## Ownership and evidence

Layer L1. Exclusive productive consumer: `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/shapes/polygon.rs`. At HEAD `a5c6b93c258acb7cb378b9b147a8c6cd0e8d17b9` with a clean tree, `01_core/src/compiler/stdlib/shapes.rs:633-888` contains the extracted behavior. SHA-256, time and state are recorded in `lab/results/construction/diagnostics/atomizacao-shapes-2026-09-30-before.json.gz`. This is internal separation by behavior.

## Contract

Construct polygon and polygon.regular as Path with points and analytical bbox, vertex count, fill/stroke, defaults and closure. Preserve the regular formula and degenerate cases.

Detailed rules, historical evidence, parity limits and diagnostics remain in `00_nucleo/prompts/core/compiler/stdlib/shapes.md`. Extraction preserves public signatures, defaults, phase and compatibility. No I/O or mutable global state is permitted.

## Acceptance

Preserve the L1 suite and shapes tests, build, and pass `crystalline-lint .` with correct ownership and hashes. Do not infer performance gains.


## Ratified Circle constructor origin

### Evidence and approval before implementation

At HEAD `954d13185e26a1ed90f6d7c60f6ba27760ca9889`, the source/owner audit in
`lab/results/v16-corrections-2026-10-19/circle-origin/l0-before.json` freezes
UTC, exact diffstat and hashes. The approved proposal
`lab/results/v16-corrections-2026-10-19/batch-f/agents/geometry/circle-deferred/proposal/review.md`
(SHA-256 `5b7136bc18f419004113d8d83c9c54adb816e3b70389039aeeed35e1c6f772e8`)
binds the baseline equality and rejected full-Length candidate receipts.
`stdlib/shapes/ellipse.rs:92-104` erased the em component;
`entities/elements/shape.rs:21-29` used one geometry carrier for both constructors.
Those observations concern language identity and geometry, not mandatory upstream
Rust structure. The explicit user approval is recorded in
`lab/results/v16-corrections-2026-10-19/circle-origin/approval-receipt.json`;
it satisfies ADR-0127 section 2 for exactly this public type/field and migration.

### Exclusive approved responsibility

Migrate this consumer's existing generic ShapeElem literals to explicit
`ShapeOrigin::Geometry`, preserving every other field, fixture, expectation,
argument, algorithm and output. Equal axes or Ellipse kind do not infer Circle.
This is only the required migration for the approved field, not a new geometry
behavior or permission to materialize any unrelated pending proposal. Full-target
compilation and existing tests must retain all current observations/tolerances.


## R13 — approved ShapeElem literal migration

The source inventory in lab/results/construction/diagnostics/relative-lines-r13-2026-10-25/migration-owners.json identifies this consumer. Owner approved the public ShapeElem.relative_line addition (proposal SHA-256 d8c9a01413232bac7113d1148af3c1b3bcd671bb37eeca68a94d5749d671db00). Initialize that field to None in existing constructors and fixture literals, preserving all geometry, paint and behavior. No other implementation change is authorized here. Full existing tests, build and lineage must pass.


## Issue 8894 — approved Stroke migration

Measurement: the source inventory and previous owner bytes in
`lab/results/construction/diagnostics/issue-8894-2026-10-31/` bind exact
HEAD/dirty diffstat/UTC and each affected source/owner before migration.
`stdlib/layout/stroke.rs:430–434` erases em; geometry.rs:81 carries only f64.
The explicit user approval in approval.json ratifies the public Length field
and occurrence-layout resolution, as specified by
`00_nucleo/prompts/core/entities/geometry.md`. This consumer retains its
exclusive responsibility and all other ratified clauses and controls.

Migrate this consumer's declarative Stroke literal thickness from scalar
points to Length::pt without changing their value or other fields. FrameStroke
remains scalar. Keep all existing semantic assertions; update only their
representation as necessary. Producers preserve full Length; layout consumers
resolve against effective font size before scalar geometry. Repr preserves
absolute/em components. RED→GREEN, build/tests and scoped lineage are required.


## Issue 8583 — approved consumer obligation

Measurement and explicit public/phase approval are bound by before/combined
source archives, baseline.json and approval.json under
`lab/results/construction/diagnostics/issue-8583-2026-10-31/`.
The radius caster at casting.rs:31–39 erases ratios and rect.rs:44–56 drops
side dictionaries. These are language geometry/paint losses.

Migrate only this consumer's ShapeElem literal/destructure: legacy rect_radius
and rect_stroke are None (or explicitly bound/observed for observation). Preserve
all existing values, expectations and other APIs; public addition is approved.
Do not materialize unrelated square/container features.
