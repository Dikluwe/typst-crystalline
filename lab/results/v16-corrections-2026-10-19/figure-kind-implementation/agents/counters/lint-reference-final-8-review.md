# Diagnostic differential inventory

Evidence-only draft for `lab/results/v16-corrections-2026-10-19/figure-kind-implementation/lint-final-8/after.sarif.gz` with 63 manifested pairs. Manual causal reconciliation is required before a final conclusion.

| Snapshot | Counts |
|---|---|
| Original baseline | {'V16:error': 20, 'V19:note': 1262, 'V20:note': 877} |
| Candidate | {'V16:error': 18, 'V19:note': 1315, 'V20:note': 905} |

Outside scope, exact complete diagnostic objects: 0 removed, 0 added. Snapshot changed inputs: []; current scope mismatches: [].

The companion JSON retains every full message, multiplicity and location, exact outside-scope objects and hashes. V19 runtime alternative coverage and V20 nested identity notes remain visible; no test can establish every alternative merely by executing a shared arm. No completion or clean-global-lint claim is made.

## Completed independent causal review

Accepted for diagnostic integrity: frozen final8 has18 V16,1315 V19 and905 V20, with no new error or warning against the original baseline. All1606 outside-scope complete objects are exactly identical, including coordinates. All63 current source/owner pairs match the sealed snapshot; changed_inputs=[] at the recorded UTC interval. The JSON binds the full dirty source state, linter identity, command and hashes.

Exactly original **V16-055** (Figure inference) and incidental **V16-100** (batch-G pipeline substitution callback) are removed. The separate original collector **V16-099** remains open. The original105 identity proof and rejected final3 addition remain preserved and hash-linked.

Every added/removed note message and multiplicity remains visible:58 added V19,30 added V20,5 removed V19 and2 removed V20. The substantive final4/final6/final7 reconciliations remain authoritative and linked in the companion JSON history. Final8 versus final7 has zero complete diagnostic-object changes: all messages, levels, rule identities, multiplicities and coordinates are identical. Equivalent snapshot? error propagation creates no diagnostic loss.

V19 grouped alternatives still require honest runtime-coverage limits; execution of one arm does not prove each named alternative. V20 nested nominal identity notes remain. Enum-extension compile controls and independently measured language tests complement, rather than erase, these notes.

Global18 V16 and bounded language debts remain, including V16-099, SetPage, full captioned default Block and ordinary Block own-label membership. This review does not assert zero global lint, full parity, F closure or the outcome of the still-running final workspace gates. Historical reviews remain unchanged.
